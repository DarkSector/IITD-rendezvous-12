IIT Delhi rendezvous 2012 QR Code system

What is it?
-----------

The system is a glorified management system that has a lot of capabilities. It registers people, assigns them a unique hash and generates a QR Code. Special classes of users are allowed and that can be manipulated in the panel by the super user. 

It is based on MongoDB and utilizes Python-Flask. It was launched on Heroku for testing. The email system was Sendgrid. So if you see a void in the init file that is because the secure server address and password along with MongoDB server URI is deleted.

One of these days I'll write documentation for it.
One of these days.

The theming was done by Supriyo Roy an IIT Delhi design student. He has done some excellent work on his own. He has a web presence, you can google his name.

This was one of the most satisfying projects. We dove into the concept with no background experience and completed almost all of it. 

History:
--------
In 2012 when I was trying to get into OU, I had taken up a design project to implement a QR code system for ticketing and secure entry system using QR Codes. I did this project at IIT Delhi under the guidance of Dr. Jyoti Kumar. The system was implemented just on the day of the opening of the college fest. Unfortunately everything was implemented by then so the system wasn't executed. Either way, it worked marvelously. It has the capability of lot of extension by an imaginative mind. We dreamt a lot of possibilities and games using the same system. I hope someone finds a use for the system.
