IIT Delhi rendezvous 2012 QR Code system

History:
--------
In 2012 when I was trying to get into OU, I had taken up a design project to implement a QR code system for ticketing and secure entry system using QR Codes. I did this project at IIT Delhi under the guidance of Dr. Jyoti Kumar. The system was implemented just on the day of the opening of the college fest. Unfortunately everything was implemented by then so the system wasn't executed. Either way, it worked marvelously. It has the capability of lot of extension by an imaginative mind. We dreamt a lot of possibilities and games using the same system. I hope someone finds a use for the system.
